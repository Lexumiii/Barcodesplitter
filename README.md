# Barcodescanner
The Barcode scanner is an easy to use tool to split invoices or any kind of pdfs, that have barcodes in them to seperate the data. If a barcode is detected, it will create a new pdf starting with that page until it finds a new barcode.


# Usage
```python app.py"```
The barcodescanner is working automatic once activated.
Put invoice pdfs with barcodes in "input" folder to split them into separate files.


# Warnings
If you get a warning in console, dont worry, it still works ;)
